# PRODIGY_ML_04
This repository includes code for developing a hand gesture recognition model designed to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The aim is to facilitate intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Here's an outline of the approach:

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is divided into training and validation sets.
Model Definition:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras.
Data Augmentation:

Techniques like ImageDataGenerator are applied for data augmentation, introducing variations into the training set.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam), categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy as the metric.
Model Training:

Training is carried out using the augmented training set. The number of epochs is specified, and validation accuracy is monitored during training.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, and the achieved accuracy is displayed.
Confusion Matrix:

The confusion matrix is computed using scikit-learn's confusion_matrix based on the model's predictions on the validation set.
Usage:

The dataset utilized is sourced from Kaggle (Hand Gesture). The code is implemented using Jupyter Notebook in Python.
Techniques:

A CNN architecture is employed for the model development.
This project leverages CNNs and data augmentation to create an effective hand gesture recognition system, with a focus on model training, validation, and performance evaluation using real-world gesture datasets.
